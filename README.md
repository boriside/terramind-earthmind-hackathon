# Digital Twins for Real Estate and Environmental Risk

A project, that connects earth observation foundation models to enable predictions for climate risks to real estate properties.

For a comprehensive real estate digital twin focused on environmental risks, we leverage both:
TerraMind: As a data powerhouse that could fill data gaps, generate realistic future scenarios (e.g., what if this area experiences a 1-in-100-year flood based on new climate projections?).
EarthMind: As the intelligence and interpretation layer. It would take the raw and generated earth observation data (from TerraMind or other sources), analyze it for specific environmental risks, and then present those risks in a human-interpretable format for the digital twin dashboard or for direct querying.

## Data (with focus Germany)

* **Geospatial Data Portals:** Many countries, including Germany, have national geospatial data portals that offer a wide range of official datasets. These are often the best starting point for national-level data.
* **European Union (EU) and Copernicus:** For Europe-wide datasets, the EU's Copernicus program and the European Environment Agency (EEA) are excellent resources.
* **Research Institutions and Agencies:** Many research institutions (e.g., DLR in Germany, NASA, USGS) and meteorological agencies provide open data for scientific and non-commercial use.
* **Commercial Providers:** For very high-resolution or specific data needs, typically they have a cost.

### 1. Satellite Imagery

#### Optical Imagery (Multispectral & Panchromatic)

* **Sentinel-2 (ESA Copernicus):**
    * **Source:** Copernicus Open Access Hub (creoDIAS, DIAS platforms) is the primary portal for Sentinel data. For Germany-specific, the DLR (German Aerospace Center) also provides Sentinel-2 Level 2A data (atmospherically corrected) for Germany via their EOC Geoservice.
        * HTTP download: `https://download.geoservice.dlr.de/S2_L2A_MAJA/files/`


* **Landsat (NASA/USGS):**
    * **Source:** EarthExplorer (USGS) is the main platform.
    * **Access:** `https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/` (requires registration).
    * **Considerations:** Good for historical context (since the 1970s), but lower resolution than Sentinel-2. You'll need to select the Landsat mission (e.g., Landsat 5, 7, 8, 9) and define your AOI (area of interest) and dates.

* **Commercial Providers (Maxar, Planet, Satellogic, etc.):**
    * **Access:** These are typically accessed via their dedicated platforms and involve licensing agreements and payment. They offer higher resolution and more frequent revisits, crucial for detailed property-level analysis.

#### Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Imagery

* **Sentinel-1 (ESA Copernicus):**
    * **Source:** Copernicus Open Access Hub or CODE-DE (German national entry point).
    * **Access:** Same as Sentinel-2, look for Sentinel-1 products on these platforms. `https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home` or via CODE-DE.
    * **Considerations:** For InSAR, you'll need to select specific acquisition modes (e.g., Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode) and process pairs of images over time. SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform) is a free software by ESA for processing SAR data.

* **TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (DLR/Airbus), Capella Space, ICEYE, Umbra:**
    * **Access:** These are commercial providers. TanDEM-X data for scientific, non-commercial use can be applied for via `https://tandemx-science.dlr.de/`.


### 2. Ancillary Geospatial Data

#### Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)

* **SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission):**
    * **Source:** NASA Earthdata, USGS EarthExplorer.
    * **Access:** `https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/` or `https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/instruments/srtm`
    * **Considerations:** Global coverage, but older data (2000). The 30m resolution global DEM is widely used.

* **ASTER GDEM:**
    * **Source:** NASA LP DAAC.
    * **Access:** `https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/astgtmv003/` or via LP DAAC Data Pool / AppEEARS.
    * **Considerations:** Global coverage, 30m resolution.

* **TanDEM-X DEM:**
    * **Source:** DLR (German Aerospace Center) and Airbus. Primarily commercial, but scientific access possible.
    * **Access:** `https://tandemx-science.dlr.de/` for scientific/non-commercial applications.
    * **Considerations:** Very high resolution (up to 12m), excellent for detailed topography in Germany.

* **National LiDAR Data:**
    * **Source:** In Germany, LiDAR data is typically managed and distributed by the **State Surveying and Cadastre Agencies (Landesvermessungsämter)** of each federal state. There isn't one central portal for all of Germany, as data availability and access policies can vary by state.
    * **Access:** You will need to search for the specific federal state's geospatial data portal (e.g., "Geoportal Bayern", "Geoportal NRW", "Geoportal Berlin"). Many provide web services (WMS/WFS) or direct download options for Digital Terrain Models (DTM) and Digital Surface Models (DSM) derived from LiDAR.
    * **Example (general resource, may link to state portals):** `https://hartilidar.eu/de` provides a general overview for LIDAR maps in Germany, but directs you to specific state sources.
    * **Considerations:** LiDAR offers very high vertical and horizontal accuracy, making it ideal for precise flood modeling and landslide analysis.

#### Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) Maps

* **Corine Land Cover (Europe):**
    * **Source:** Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (European Environment Agency - EEA) and DLR for Germany-specific products.
    * **Access:**

    * **Access:** Available through the Earthdata CMR Search. `https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C2655129178-FEDEO.html`
    * **Considerations:** Global, 10m resolution, recent product (2020, 2021 versions).

* **National LULC Datasets (Germany):**
    * **Source:** German federal states often have their own detailed LULC datasets, sometimes derived from ATKIS (Official Topographical Cartographic Information System). The Helmholtz-Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) also develops Germany-wide LULC classifications from Sentinel-2 data.
    * **Access:**
        * **UFZ:** "Land-use / Land-cover classification" section for downloads (e.g., `https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=51858`).
        * **Federal State Geoportals:** Again, the individual state geospatial agencies (e.g., Landesamt für Digitalisierung, Breitband und Vermessung Bayern) are the best source for highly detailed national LULC.

#### Weather and Climate Data

* **Historical Extreme Weather Events (Germany):**
    * **Source:** German Weather Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst - DWD) is the primary source for meteorological data in Germany. They have an open data portal.
    * **Access:** `https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/opendata/opendata.html` Look for climate data, historical observations, and extreme event records.
    * **Considerations:** Data may be in various formats (e.g., CSV, NetCDF) and require processing.

* **Climate Change Projections (CMIP6 data):**
    * **Source:** Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) nodes.
    * **Access:** The German ESGF node is at DKRZ (Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum): `https://esgf-data.dkrz.de/search/cmip6-dkrz/`

* **Reanalysis Datasets (ERA5):**
    * **Source:** Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS).
    * **Access:** `https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels`
    * **Considerations:** ERA5 provides a consistent global reanalysis dataset from 1940 to present. You can select specific variables, time ranges, and geographical areas.

#### Hydrological Data

* **River Networks:**
    * **Source:** Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) based at the Federal Institute of Hydrology (BfG) in Germany. OpenStreetMap (OSM) also has extensive river network data.
    * **Access:**
        * **GRDC:** `https://mrb.grdc.bafg.de/` (Look for "Major River Basins" and "Major River Networks" layers).
        * **OpenStreetMap (OSM):** You can download OSM data extracts for Germany from platforms like Geofabrik `https://www.geofabrik.de/data/download.html` (look for Germany extracts in Shapefile or PBF format). Be aware that OSM data quality can vary.
        * **Federal State Water Management Agencies:** Similar to LiDAR, individual state agencies often provide more detailed hydrological data.

* **Flood Plain Maps:**
    * **Source:** National hydrological agencies in Germany, often at the federal state level, as well as the Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG).
    * **Access:**
        * **BKG Flood Atlas:** `https://atlas.bkg.bund.de/webapps/hochwasseratlas/` (interactive web application, might offer data download or links to relevant sources).
        * **European Flood Awareness System (EFAS):** `https://www.efas.eu/de` (provides forecasts and can be a source of historical flood information).
        * **Individual Federal State Portals:** Search for "Hochwassergefahrenkarten" (flood hazard maps) or "Überschwemmungsgebiete" (floodplains) on the websites of the respective state environmental or water management agencies.
        * **PEGELONLINE:** `https://www.pegelonline.wsv.de/gast/start` provides water levels from gauges, useful for understanding current flood situations.

* **Historical Flood Extents:**
    * This is often more challenging to find as direct, readily downloadable GIS layers. You might need to:
        * Consult reports from the DWD or state environmental agencies on past major flood events.
        * Derive them from historical satellite imagery (optical or SAR) by mapping inundated areas if the event coincided with satellite acquisitions.
        * Look for specific studies or datasets published by research institutions.

#### Geological/Soil Data

* **Geological Surveys:**
    * **Source:** The State Geological Surveys of Germany (`Landesämter für Geologie`) are responsible for geological mapping and data. There is a joint website called "Infogeo" that links to these state agencies.
    * **Access:** `https://www.infogeo.de/Infogeo/EN/Startseite/startseite_node_en.html` From here, you'll need to navigate to the specific state geological survey relevant to your AOI to find their data products (e.g., geological maps, borehole data).

* **Soil Maps:**
    * **Source:** European Soil Portal (JRC), ISRIC (World Soil Information), and national soil databases.
    * **Access:**
        * **ISRIC Soil Geographic Databases (Europe):** `https://www.isric.org/soil-geographic-databases-europe` This page provides links to various European soil datasets, including those relevant to Germany (e.g., European Soil Database, AI4SoilHealth project data).
        * **Federal State Soil Surveys:** Similar to geological data, individual federal states may have more detailed soil maps. Search their respective environmental or agricultural agency websites.


## Pipeline Workflow:

### 1. Data Acquisition:
Download Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (Multispectral) imagery for your real estate property's area of interest over historical periods and current acquisitions. Potentially in an area with a river. Get high-resolution commercial imagery for the specific property.

### 2. Initial Pre-processing:
Prepare/ clean data.

### 3. TerraMind for Data Augmentation/Simulation:
Use TerraMind to generate Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from available optical imagery for periods with data gaps.
Input climate model projections into TerraMind to simulate future land cover changes or flood extents under different climate scenarios, generating new data/images.

### 4. EarthMind for Understanding and Risk Assessment:
Feed the combined historical, current, and simulated future earth observation data into EarthMind.
Query EarthMind:
"What is the historical flood frequency for [Property Address]?"
"Are there signs of ground subsidence around [Property Address] from 2010-2024 based on SAR?"
"What is the current vegetation fire risk for [Property Address] given current conditions and surrounding land cover?"
"Based on projected climate data, what is the likelihood of increased heat stress for [Property Address] by 2050?"
EarthMind processes these visual and multi-modal inputs to provide human-interpretable answers, potentially with confidence scores or visual overlays.

### 5. Model Validation
Find satelite images from 10 years and run the foundation models pipeline to see if the reality matches the prediction.

### 6. Digital Twin Integration
The insights, risk scores, and interpreted maps from EarthMind (and potentially the raw/generated data) are then fed into your digital twin platform for visualization, alerts, and further analysis with property-specific data.
