# Digital Twins for Real Estate and Environmental Risk

A project, that connects earth observation foundation models to enable predictions for climate risks to real estate properties.

For a comprehensive real estate digital twin focused on environmental risks, we leverage both:
TerraMind: As a data powerhouse that could fill data gaps, generate realistic future scenarios (e.g., what if this area experiences a 1-in-100-year flood based on new climate projections?).
EarthMind: As the intelligence and interpretation layer. It would take the raw and generated earth observation data (from TerraMind or other sources), analyze it for specific environmental risks, and then present those risks in a human-interpretable format for the digital twin dashboard or for direct querying.

## Pipeline Workflow:

### 1. Data Acquisition:
Download Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (Multispectral) imagery for your real estate property's area of interest over historical periods and current acquisitions. Potentially in an area with a river. Get high-resolution commercial imagery for the specific property.

### 2. Initial Pre-processing:
Prepare/ clean data.

### 3. TerraMind for Data Augmentation/Simulation:
Use TerraMind to generate Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from available optical imagery for periods with data gaps.
Input climate model projections into TerraMind to simulate future land cover changes or flood extents under different climate scenarios, generating new data/images.

### 4. EarthMind for Understanding and Risk Assessment:
Feed the combined historical, current, and simulated future earth observation data into EarthMind.
Query EarthMind:
"What is the historical flood frequency for [Property Address]?"
"Are there signs of ground subsidence around [Property Address] from 2010-2024 based on SAR?"
"What is the current vegetation fire risk for [Property Address] given current conditions and surrounding land cover?"
"Based on projected climate data, what is the likelihood of increased heat stress for [Property Address] by 2050?"
EarthMind processes these visual and multi-modal inputs to provide human-interpretable answers, potentially with confidence scores or visual overlays.

### 5. Model Validation
Find satelite images from 10 years and run the foundation models pipeline to see if the reality matches the prediction.

### 6. Digital Twin Integration
The insights, risk scores, and interpreted maps from EarthMind (and potentially the raw/generated data) are then fed into your digital twin platform for visualization, alerts, and further analysis with property-specific data.
